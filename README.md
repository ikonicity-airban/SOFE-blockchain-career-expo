A **hands-on, project-based curriculum** to master backend development with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Drizzle ORM), JWT Auth, Jest testing**, and **free-tier deployment** — all in **just 4 weeks**.

Originally a 6-week program, **condensed into 24 focused 3-hour live sessions** (3 days/week) for college students transitioning from **HTML/CSS/JS** to **production-ready backend engineering**.

---

### What’s Inside:
- **Week 1**: Node.js fundamentals, CLI apps, npm, GitHub workflow  
- **Week 2**: Async programming, HTTP servers, REST API design  
- **Week 3**: Express.js + CRUD, Drizzle ORM + MongoDB, JWT auth  
- **Week 4**: Testing (Jest), rate limiting, Swagger docs, free deployment (Render/Railway)

---

### Features:
- Daily **live-coding sessions** with **starter + solution branches**
- **Mini-exercises** (15 mins) + **weekly homework** (PR-based)
- **Jest tests** included for every feature
- **Free resources only**: Dave Gray, freeCodeCamp, codedamn
- **MongoDB Atlas + Drizzle ORM** (TypeScript-ready)
- **100% free deployment** (no AWS/Heroku paid tiers)

---

### Final Project:
A **secure, documented, tested RESTful API** (e.g., Task Manager) deployed live with:
- JWT authentication
- CRUD operations
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Swagger docs
- Jest test coverage

---

### For Students:
> “From frontend to full-stack in 4 weeks.”  
> Build confidence, a portfolio, and real backend skills.

---

**Instructor**: 1-on-1 live coaching | **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas  
**No prior backend experience required** — just basic JS!
